We'll be using this page to organize the final projects for [Governing Virtual Worlds](https://hls.harvard.edu/academics/curriculum/catalog/default.aspx?o=72386).

## Roles

Choose your role.

1. *Architect*. Work on a project. Architects can choose to work on a team.
2. *Analyst*. Work on a paper. Analysts work alone.

Over the course of 5 weeks, Architects will develop governance proposals for a virtual world of their choice, while facing criticism from Analysts (and other Architects).

## Prize

One outstanding project and one outstanding analysis will be recognized at the end of the course. Prizes TBA.

## Criteria

**Creative**: how is the project different from previous alternatives? Be audacious; don't just build a better mousetrap.

**Impactful**: does the project solve a significant governance problem in the virtual world, whether for users or for the operator? Does it significantly improve "welfare" in the world in some sense?

**Realistic**: is the project do-able, whether commercially, technologically, or politically? We know things can be complicated. But be honest about the obstacles, and tell us how you plan on overcoming them.

**Well-researched**: if you make a claim, back it up with a reason or a citation. If you were inspired by a particular solution from somewhere else, say so. Give us some insight into your thought process.

## Challenges

Governance, writ large, is concerned with collective action. If you're looking for inspiration for a governance proposal, consider some of the following challenges for governance:

**Facebook** is facing a torrent of criticism these days, from ongoing suspicions about its role in undermining democratic elections to its use as a platform for terrorist propaganda to [recent](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c) [proposals](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/opinion/facebook-antitrust-investigation.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage) to break it up. For Mark Zuckerburg, AI is the answer. What's your answer?

**One Hour One Life** is an indie game in which players work together to re-create civilization. Jason, the designer, has detailed several experiments on how to control (but not eliminate) the rate of murders in the game, and also explained what players did in the absence of specific controls. Are there other options to control murder in OHOL?

**Decentraland** bills itself as a truly user-owned virtual world. 

**Walden 2**. Walden 2 is B.F. Skinner's utopia, constructed from .

## Sample proposal

[**Seed**](www.seed-project.io) is an upcoming sandbox MMO where players must band together—and govern together—in order to settle a new world. Here's an sample proposal that uses AI to simulate "culture".
