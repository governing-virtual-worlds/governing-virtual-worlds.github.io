We'll be using this page to organize the final projects for [Governing Virtual Worlds](https://hls.harvard.edu/academics/curriculum/catalog/default.aspx?o=72386).

## Roles

Choose your role.

1. *Architect*. Work on a project. Architects can choose to work on a team.
2. *Analyst*. Work on a paper. Analysts work alone.

Over the course of 5 weeks, Architects will develop governance proposals for a virtual world of their choice, while facing criticism from Analysts (and other Architects). Look out for announcements and assignments on Canvas.

## Prizes

One outstanding project and one outstanding analysis will be recognized at the end of the course. Prizes TBA.

## Publication

We will publish the final versions of every project (and relevant analyses, with your permission) on this site.

## Criteria

**Creative**: how is the project different from previous alternatives? Be audacious; don't just build a better mousetrap.

**Impactful**: does the project solve a significant governance problem in the virtual world, whether for users or for the operator? Does it significantly improve "welfare" in some sense?

**Realistic**: is the project do-able, whether commercially, technologically, or politically? We know things can be complicated. But be honest about the obstacles, and tell us how you plan on overcoming them.

**Well-researched**: if you make a claim, back it up with a reason or a citation. If you were inspired by a particular solution from somewhere else, say so. Give us some insight into your thought process.

## Challenges

Governance, writ large, is concerned with collective action. If you're looking for inspiration for a governance proposal, consider some of the following examples of governance challenges:

After recent missteps, **Facebook** is facing a torrent of criticism from activists, media, and regulators. Among the many criticisms: it helps spread propaganda and disinformation because bad actors can subvert its data and network, it fosters armchair activism because it replaces active engagement with "likes", it's a threat to democracy because it polarizes communities. Yet [nothing seems to change](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/opinion/facebook-antitrust-investigation.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage). Mark Zuckerburg wants to fix the platform by implementing more AI; Elizabeth Warren wants to [break it up](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c). How would you design Facebook v2?

**One Hour One Life** is an indie game in which players work together to re-create civilization. Jason, the designer, has talked about several experiments on how to control (but not eliminate) the rate of murders in the game, and also explained what players did in the absence of his controls. Are there other options to control murder in OHOL, and to turn it into a more "productive" feature of the game?

**Decentraland** bills itself as a truly [user-owned virtual world](https://medium.com/decentraland/introducing-the-decentraland-whitepaper-c115a17c77a9). Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses a market system to facilitate the buying and selling of LAND: little patches of VR real estate, similar to web domains, on which users can place and monetize "games" of their own. The vision is big, and the mock-ups look shiny, but the [implementation may be spotty](https://medium.com/@mattcondon/thoughts-on-decentraland-6a6ddbf9cd4a) and [questions remain](https://farsightpodcast.com/2019/03/06/opportunity-and-exit-what-decentraland-can-learn-from-second-life/)... and didn't Second Life already pioneer the sale-and-monetization of virtual land? A lot depends on how governance and collective decision-making is implemented in the world, especially if there is no central authority that can intervene. How would you implement such a governance system in Decentraland?

**Walden 2** is B.F. Skinner's utopia, a small-scale model of human perfectibility enabled by behavioral psychology. In the novel, Frazier, the architect of Walden 2, articulates a vision of the good life that goes "[beyond freedom and dignity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Freedom_and_Dignity)". Frazier's philosophical opponent, Castle, calls him a fascist. Whatever you might think of Walden 2, our worlds (virtual and not) are governed more and more by a kind of technological behaviorism. How would you update Walden 2 for today's world, using today's technologies, reflecting today's norms? Show us a vision of Walden 3.

## A sample proposal

[**Seed**](www.seed-project.io) is an upcoming sandbox MMO where players must band together in cities and settlements as they colonize a new world. Gameplay will be a cross between the Sims (players control several AI settlers at once) and EVE Online (the world is vast, and it's always changing even if the player logs off). To succeed, players in a settlement must work together, and they have a range of governance mechanisms to help: a choice of government form and constitution, tools to manage the economy, a rudimentary (player-run) justice system, and recorded contracts between players. But not all governance mechanisms need to be explicit or "legal"; some of them can be quite subtle. [Here's a sample proposal that uses AI to simulate "culture" in Seed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10GQFbj8mPPwey8RQZxavkvQ0q6px0gAjNe2JFeWNCHg).

## Key dates

2. Tuesday, April 2: Primavera de Filippi on blockchain and governance
3. Tuesday, April 9: Louis Kang on AI and (virtual) markets
4. More TBA.
